      <b>Instead of making a New Year's resolution</b>, I'm making a bingo card
      of things I want to do in <b>2024</b>. Some of these goals are lofty, some
      are silly or "trivial", and some just aren't fully in my control.
      <br />
      <br />
      A <b>successful result 🎉</b> for me is that I can look back at the end of
      the year and celebrate the things I did do, but not feel guilty about the
      things that didn't happen.

      🔎 <b><i>Something fun to note about this page:</i></b> there is zero
      javascript! The bingo card is made with CSS grid, and the modal card takes
      advantage of the <code>:target</code> CSS pseudo-class. This also means
      that you can link directly to this info card or to a specific square on
      the bingo card, like <a href="#modal13">this</a>!

      various museums and events, got to chat with the organizer of Roc The
      Eclipse, listened to so many sun- and moon-themed songs, and still got to
      experience the pure nighttime of the total solar eclipse. Don't regret the
      trip in the slightest, and we're already looking at options for the total
      eclipses in Spain and Australia! 🌒🌓🌔🌕🌖🌗🌘

      <a href="https://bughunterbug.com">Bug Hunter</a> and the Narcissist
      Cookbook are two artists that have made a huge impact on my life. I want
      to make something for them, some little piece of art or something to show
      my appreciation for all they've done for me.

      ✅ <b>Aug 17</b> - We saw an absolutely amazing show for the Bug Hunter +
      Narcissist Cookbook tour in NYC! I built a custom PCB for each of them
      that played various clips from their songs and the boards were shaped like
      Bug Hunter's "Caterbug", and tNC's "strange creature" logo. It was so cool
      to see them again and to share some of my art with them.

      This is probably this silliest one on the list, but I've never lived
      anywhere that really got snow before! I'm sure it'll get old fast, but
      it'll be something new to clear off the driveway and sidewalk, maybe even
      have to dig out the car!

      ✅ <b>Jan 16</b> - This was the second snow of the season! I learned
      during the first snow that landlords in MA are legally obligated to clear
      snow for access paths and sidewalks for their properties. I definitely
      can't complain about having it taken care of for me! We needed the car
      this time though, so I dug it out and cleared off the driveway.

      I've not taught a class in a while, and I miss it. Whether it's something
      more structured like a specific project workshop, or more general like
      "Intro to PCB design with KiCad", I'd like to teach something this year!

      ✅ <b>Sep 22</b> - While there are a handful of cases I could probably
      point at to call this one done, my favorite this year was chatting with a
      friend at a birthday party and getting them excited about trying out
      CircuitPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico! They had been wanting to get back
      into some embedded programming, and I had an extra Pico on hand, so I've
      been enjoying seeing them work on something that should end up being
      really fun and cool!

    <div class="content">
      One of my weaknesses is that I have a lot of ideas, half-started projects,
      and things that I want to do, but I don't always finish them. I might try
      to launch a Kickstarter for one of my projects this year, even if it's as
      simple as an enamel pin. Gotta experience the process for myself!
