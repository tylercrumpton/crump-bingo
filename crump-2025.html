    <div class="content">
      <b>Instead of making New Year's resolutions</b>, I made a bingo card of
      things I wanted to do in 2024. It was super fun, and a handful of friends
      and family joined in, so I'm keeping it going in <b>2025</b>! Some of
      these goals are lofty, some are silly or "trivial", and some just aren't
      fully in my control.
      <br />
      <br />
      A <b>successful result 🎉</b> for me is that I can look back at the end of
      the year and celebrate the things I did do, but not feel guilty about the
      things that didn't happen.

    <div class="content">
      🔎 <b><i>Something fun to note about this page:</i></b> there is zero
      javascript! The bingo card is made with CSS grid, and the modal card takes
      advantage of the <code>:target</code> CSS pseudo-class. This also means
      that you can link directly to this info card or to a specific square on
      the bingo card, like <a href="#modal13">this</a>!

      I've not taught a class in a while, and I miss it. Whether it's something
      more structured like a specific project workshop, or more general like
      "Intro to PCB design with KiCad", I'd like to teach something this year!
